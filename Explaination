def min_players_to_get_shot(N, K, heights):
    count = 0

    for height in heights:
        if height > K:
            count += 1

    return count
=>   This function, min_players_to_get_shot, takes three parameters: N (number of players between Gi-Hun and Ali), K (height of Gi-Hun and Ali), and heights (a list containing the heights of players between Gi-Hun and Ali). It calculates and returns the minimum number of players who need to get shot so that Ali is visible in Gi-Hun's line of sight.

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())
=>This reads the number of test cases T from the input.

for _ in range(T):
    # Read N and K for each test case
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
=>This loop iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of N and K from the input.

    # Read the heights of players between Gi-Hun and Ali
    heights = list(map(int, input().split()))
=>This line reads the heights of players between Gi-Hun and Ali as a list.


    # Calculate and print the minimum number of players to get shot
    result = min_players_to_get_shot(N, K, heights)
    print(result)
=>It then calls the min_players_to_get_shot function with the provided parameters and prints the result for each test case.

Here's an example of how the code works with the provided sample input:

3
4 10
2 13 4 16
5 8
9 3 8 8 4
4 6
1 2 3 4


Output:
2
1
0
Test Case 1: The second and fourth players need to get shot.
Test Case 2: Only the first player needs to get shot.
Test Case 3: No player needs to get shot as all are shorter than Gi-Hun and Ali.
